       <h2>Passion and Research</h2>
       <span>Ciao Vino is passion and research</span>
       <p>
           Irrepressible passion for all things that are good – for quality products, 
           artisanal and well-made, offered by small producers or large companies with 
           love and professionalism.
        </p>
        <p>
            A constant search for excellence, for anything that requires a deeper 
            understanding, studies, stories, work, and dedication.
        </p>
        <p>
            All that Ciao Vino has is the result of careful and perfectionist selection, 
            which always leads, whether in the countryside of Italy or in small towns 
            outside Italy, to production that remains attentive to the traditions and 
            proper methods of processing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Passion and research are applied at Ciao Vino, to the dishes presented at the 
            wine bar, the labels of the winery, to the cheeses and cold cuts.

                        heart of this cheese. Poetry of taste.

                        Made from raw cow milk. Traditionally, cows have to be fed only on grass or hay, producing grass fed milk. True Parmesan 
                        cheese has a sharp, complex fruity/nutty taste with its granular texture that melts in your mouth. Is the king of made
