    <main>
        <h2>Food and Wine</h2>
        <p>
            My philosophy of food and wine is very picturesque. For centuries, food and wine have played 
            an important role in numerous cultures. Their combined impact can be traced throughout the 
            Greek and Roman Empires as an integral part of celebrations, customs, and ceremonies. Today, 
            gourmet food and wines have emerged as a driving force in an ever-widening market, and, as a 
            result, they have become more accessible to the average consumer.  It is my experience that, 
            in the past several years, there has been a shared effort by restaurateurs who possess, both 
            the passion for, and knowledge of, high quality food and wine, and to make them more consumer 
            friendly.  Also, there has been much worldwide research about the benefits to oneâ€™s health of 
            the moderate consumption of wine and a balanced diet. Because of these relatively new 
            developments, the US has become the largest consumer of wine and Mediterranean food. I believe 
            that food and wine will become the most integral part of our lives. Food and wine are the philosophy of life. 
        </p>
        <h2>Business</h2>
        <p>
            I am very open, and try to make the world brighter and livelier. My opinion about life is very 
            positive. I think that in any difficult situation, there is a way, and I will never lose heart. 
            I solve problems with positivity. I believe in life, I never give up, and I am never 
            discouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
            The food and wine business is all about good listening skills, observation, decision making, personality, 
            and establishing the right networking relationships. You can have the best wine in the world, but if you 
            don't have the personality and friendships, you will never sell it. Wine, food, and business are all about 
            relationships. If people feel you care about them and their best interests, they will give you their business. 
            If people grow to love you, they will give you their business for life, and refer you to all their friends.
